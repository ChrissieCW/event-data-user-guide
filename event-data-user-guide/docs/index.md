Welcome to the Crossref Event Data User Guide. It contains everything you need to know about Crossref Event Data (and probably a little more), from a high-level overview down to the details in-depth. It is split into four sections:

 - 'Introduction' is a high level overview of the service and background and is suitable for everyone.
 - 'The Service' describes the Event Data service and how to use it.
 - 'Concepts' covers some of the issues that should be understood before using Event Data.
 - 'In Depth' describes all the technical detail required to understand and integrate with the service from top to bottom and is suitable for a technical or research audience.

Crossref Event Data is an open, flexible service, which can be put to many uses. We aim to set the standard in openness and transparency so the documentation not only describes the service, but precisely how we generate it. It's important to understand exactly what the data means and how it was collected to ensure you interpret it wisely.
