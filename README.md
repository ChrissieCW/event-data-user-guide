# Event Data User Manual

User manual for Crossref Event Data. Currently under development. This repository doesn't contain the rendered output (PDF and HTML). For now ask Joe.

## Editing

Edit the `event-data-manual.md` Markdown file. To build run `./build.sh`. Remember to build and check it in after changing so other people can read it.

## Requirements

Requires [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).
