# The Event Data Service

This section describes the Event Data service and how to interact with it to get retrieve. Later sections describe what you should do once you've got it! The service comprises:

 - The **Query API** which provides access to Events in bulk,
 - The **Evidence Registry** which supplies supporting evidence and provenance information for Events,
 - The **Artifact Registry** which supplies supporting data used by Agents as they produce Events,
 - The **Reports Service** which contains data on the performance and activity of the system.
