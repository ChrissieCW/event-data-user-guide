# Evidence Registry

The Evidence Registry stores all the Evidence that supports Events collected by Crossref. Other partners who share information via CED may not include Evidence Records. All Evidence Records are produced by the [Percolator](../sources/percolator). Most of the time you will be accessing the Evidence Regisry because you followed a link from an Event.

To find an Evidence record for an Event look at the `evidence` field. If an Event has an Evidence Record, it will be linked in this field.

See the [Evidence Records](../data/evidence-records) section for a description of the Evidence Record format.
