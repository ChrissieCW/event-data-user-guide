# The Event Data Service

This section describes the Event Data service and how to interact with it to retrieve data. Later sections describe what you should do with the data once you've got it! The service comprises:

 - The **Query API** which provides access to Events in bulk,
 - The **Evidence Registry** which supplies supporting evidence and provenance information for Events,
 - The **Evidence Logs** which allows you to download Evidence Logs in bulk,
 - The **Artifact Registry** which supplies supporting data used by Agents as they produce Events,
