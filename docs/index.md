 - [Introduction](introduction) is a high level overview of the service and background and is suitable for everyone.
 - [The Service](service) describes the Event Data service and how to use it.
 - [Concepts](concepts) covers some of the issues that should be understood before using Event Data.

If you're keen to get your hands on the data you can jump straight to the [Quick Start](quick-start) page.

Crossref Event Data is an open, flexible service, which can be put to many uses. We aim to set the standard in openness and transparency. This User Guide describes the service and how it works. It also describes in detail how the data is collected. It's important to understand exactly what the data means and how it was collected to ensure you interpret it wisely.
