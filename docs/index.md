Welcome to the Crossref Event Data User Guide. It contains everything you need to know about Crossref Event Data (and probably a little more), from a high-level overview down to the details in-depth. **This guide is suitable for everyone**. Hopefully it will provide everything from a gentle introduction right down to the the tiny details. Read the chapters of this guide in order for a complete tour of CED.

If you're keen to get your hands on the data you can jump straight to the [Quick Start](quick-start) page.

If you want to use CED for whatever reason, you are strongly encouraged to read the entire guide. CED is an open, flexible service that gathers data from a range of sources. It's important that you understand where the data comes from, how it's processed, and what you should bear in in mind when using it.
