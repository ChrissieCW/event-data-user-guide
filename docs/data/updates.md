#Â Updates to Events

Events are never *removed* from the system, but they are sometimes updated. Because immutability and stability are important design principles, we will avoid doing this where possible. We will make edits under the following circumstances:

 - Where we are contractually obliged to. For example, Twitter requires us to monitor deleted tweets and update our data to remove the deleted material accordingly.
 - Where Events have been produced as the result of a bug. For example, if Events are issued for DOIs that don't exist and the Event is therefore invalid.

For example, if an Agent has a bug that generates Events with invalid DOIs, and we are able to clean them up and mark the Events as edited, we will update those Events. If it generates non-existent DOIs, we may mark those Events as deleted. If a user deletes a tweet that's refereced from an Event, we will erase the tweet ID and author ID from the Event, leaving the rest untouched, and mark it as deleted.

If an Event is updated, three fields will be set:

 - `updated` - will have a value of `deleted` or `edited`
 - `updated_reason` - optional, may point to an announcement page explaining the edit
 - `updated_date` - ISO8601 date string for when the event was updated.

By default, the Query API **will not** serve Events that have been already been `deleted`, but **will** serve Events that have been `edited`. See the [Query API documentation](/service/query-api) for more details.
