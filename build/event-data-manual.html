<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Crossref Event Data (CED) is a service for collecting and distributing the events that occur around scholarly research objects. It concerns primarily articles in Crossref and datasets in DataCite that have a DOI. For the purposes of this document, 'Research Object' will be used to mean any item in Crossref (including articles, books, conference proceedings, etc) or in DataCite (including datasets etc) that has a DOI. 'Research object' is used to mean any item that has a DOI.</p>
<p>This data will be available via an API, where users can browse, integrate it with other software or conduct experiments.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-event">What is an Event?</h2>
<p>The world of Event Data is varied, and CED aims to capture data from as wide a range of sources as possible. An 'ideal' event can be described as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an action that occurs that concerns a Research Object</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the types of events, and they way in which they can be collected, are varied. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>someone tweeted mentioning a DOI</li>
<li>someone liked an article on Facebook</li>
<li>a reference to an article was added to Wikipedia using its DOI</li>
</ul>
<p>Just as the events are varied, so too are the methods we can use to collect them. We can capture and represent an individual tweet but Facebook only gives us access to a count of how many times a DOI has been liked. Wikipedia also poses an interesting challenge because a reference can be added or removed, so depending when you query the system, a reference may or may not exist.</p>
<p>There are also different types of data consumers who have different requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>an author wants to know if article was mentioned on twitter</li>
<li>a bibliometrician wants to know what time of day people tweet about DOIs</li>
<li>a Wikipedian wants to know how often DOI references are removed from articles</li>
</ul>
<p>For this reason, we represent Events in two layers of detail: Relations and Deposits.</p>
<h3 id="relations">Relations</h3>
<p>A Relation is a single piece of information that concerns a research object. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>twitter.com/CrossrefOrg/status/517313741491552256</code> mentioned <code>doi.org/10.5555/12345678</code> on 12th November 2014.</li>
<li>On Facebook, the DOI <code>doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8</code> was liked 5 times as of 25 November 2016.</li>
<li><code>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish</code> references <code>doi.org/10.1007%2Fs003600050092</code> as of 24 September 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>These relations resemble triples, but include a date stamp and an optional count. For some sources, such as Twitter, they represent individual events that happened. For some sources, such as Facebook, they represent a count of events without any further detail because that is what is available. For some sources, such as Wikipedia, they represent the most recent state.</p>
<h3 id="deposits">Deposits</h3>
<p>Relations aren't able to capture all activity. A Deposit is a single data point that records when CED became aware of new information. Examples of Deposits are:</p>
<ul>
<li>On 12th November 2014, Twitter reported that tweet <code>twitter.com/CrossrefOrg/status/517313741491552256</code> was published and it mentioned <code>doi.org/10.5555/12345678</code>.</li>
<li>On 26th November 2016, CED contacted Facebook on 25 November 2016, and Facebook reported that the <code>doi.org/10.1016/0300-9629(73)90490-8</code> currently had 5 likes.</li>
<li>On 24th September 2015, Wikipedia reported that there was an edit to the article <code>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish</code> in which a reference to <code>doi.org/10.1007%2Fs003600050092</code> was removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="working-with-events">Working with Events</h3>
<p>For most tasks, Relations will be of use. They help you to answer questions like &quot;when was this DOI tweeted?&quot; or &quot;is this DOI mentioned in Wikipedia?&quot;. The Relations API provides bulk access to these events. It allows users to retrieve all Relations, or to filter them to only retrieve relations of a certain type or from a certain source (e.g. Wikipedia).</p>
<p>When it is important to get more detail on what exactly occurred to produce a Relation, the Deposit API will provide it. For example, it can help you to answer questions like &quot;was this DOI reference removed from Wikipedia repeatedly?&quot;. It can also answer questions like &quot;when exactly in the past has CED queried Facebook about this DOI&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h1>
<p>Crossref Event Data is currently at MVP stage, which is a proof of concept with a limited number of sources. As we move toward a full release, more data sources, partners and methods for accessing data will be added.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#sources">Sources</a> section for a list of currently available sources.</p>

<h2 id="events-deposits-relations">Events, Deposits &amp; Relations</h2>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="#what-is-an-event">What is an Event</a> section, Event Data is represented as Relations and Deposits. These are available on the Event Data API. The API is web-based and uses JSON so you can easily develop software to work with it or try it out in your browser.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the following options are available:</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
<p>All of the Relations and Deposits data is available to everyone. We will make every effort to ensure that the Relations and Deposit APIs are available. As we are providing this as a free-to-access service, we cannot guarantee availability and high demand may produce occasional fluctuations in service. At some point in the future we will introduce a paid-for Sevice Level Agreement (SLA), which will provide agreements about the availability of the service. They will provide exatly the same data.</p>
<p>All Relations in CED will be available via the Relations API, and once there is a Relation in CED, it will always be available in its most up-to-date form on the API unless it is deleted. For practical reasons due to the high volume of data, the Deposits are <em>not</em> guaranteed to be available on the Deposits API forever. Deposits will be archived to the deposit log after a certain period of time so data will never be lost or become unavailable.</p>
<p>The exact period of time before Deposits are archived to the Deposit Log are to be determined, based on real-world observations.</p>
<h2 id="deleted-data">Deleted data</h2>
<p>Relations can be deleted. For example, when a reference from a Wikipedia article to a DOI is removed, that reference no longer exists. CED aims to always have the most up-to-date state as far as possible.</p>
<p>When a Relation is deleted, it will be because of a particular Deposit which included an instruction to delete it. All Deposit events are retained in the Deposit API and log, so no information is lost. If you are interested in, for example, Wikipedia deletions, can find every addition and deletion of a reference in the Deposits.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-api">Using the API</h2>
<p>The API is available via HTTP. You can try it out in your browser or easily integrate it with your software. If you're using Chrome, we suggest you use JSONView (available for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/jsonview/">Firefox</a>) to make it easier to read the output.</p>

<li>Crossref Related</li>
</ul>
<p>Full details of each source are provided below.</p>
<h2 id="push-vs-pull">Push vs Pull</h2>
<p>Every Source operates by communicating with an external service via its API to retrieve information. Data sources are divided into those where the external service is able to send data directly to CED ('Push Sources') and those that require CED to initiate a request ('Pull Sources').</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="build/pushpull.png" alt="Push vs Pull" />
<p class="caption">Push vs Pull</p>
</div>
<p>Pull sources, for example Facebook, provide some kind of interface that CED must go out and query. Most sources require one request to be made for each DOI we are interested in. Because of this, the data that we have for a pull source is only as recent as the last time we checked against it.</p>
<p>Because of techincal limitations like bandwidth, external organisations imposing rate limits on their APIs, and because there are around 100 million DOIs in existence, we cannot check every DOI against every Pull Source and we are limited in how often we can make queries.</p>
<p>CED will aim to update data from pull sources as often as possible, but this will fluctuate depending on real-world observations.</p>
<p>Push sources, for example Wikipedia, are able to send data directly to CED. This means that there are no limitations on the selection of DOIs (a Push source can send data about any DOI at any time) and it means that the data can be much fresher. Some push sources send data live as it is happening (e.g. Wikipedia), although it is up to the push source how often it pushes data. Some push sources may push data in batches. See the documentation for each source for details.</p>
<h2 id="selection-of-dois">Selection of DOIs for Pull Sources</h2>
<p>Pull Sources work by making a query against an external service for a given DOI. To do this, it maintains an internal list of DOIs. As it's not practical to store every single extant DOI, CED only stores DOIs that it thinks are likely to have event data. This means that some events may not be captured because CED doesn't know about, and therefore can't query for, the DOI. It also means that even if there is some event data for a given Research Object, it only goes as far back as the time when CED became aware of it.</p>
<p>Every time CED learns about a new DOI, for example via a push source, it is placed on the list. The current mechanism is to rely on DOIs that enter via push sources.</p>

<p>An input trigger event corresponds to a change in any Wikipedia property. Because there is a very high volume of edits (up to 2 million per day) it is impractical to store triggers for which no DOIs were found. When an trigger does correspond to an event because a DOI was added or removed (50 thousand triggers per day), it is stored. When a trigger is stored it is given a UUID. Because an edit to a Wikipedia page (which would be treated as one trigger) can introduce more than one DOI reference, every trigger may correspond to one or more events.</p>
<p>A monthly audit log of triggers is stored and may be available to users to wish to audit Wikipedia events. Each month's logs contain a log of events that correlate the trigger id, the event id and the relevant Wikipedia information:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>input-event-id</code>: trigger UUID, e.g. <code>c0eb1c46-6a59-49c9-926b-a10667ddd9de</code></li>
<li><code>event-id</code>: event UUID (available on Deposits data) <code>646c0a88-1905-47d8-a21f-6a86fbb384db</code></li>
<li><code>server-name</code>: Wikipedia server, e.g. <code>en.wikipedia.org</code></li>
<li><code>title</code>: article title, e.g. <code>Fish</code></li>
<li>timestamp of edit event</li>
<li>old revision ID within Wikipedia, e.g. <code>1000</code></li>
<li>new revision ID within Wikipedia, e.g. <code>1001</code></li>

<p>Crossref Crossref Event Data reports raw events, not metrics. The following events are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Links from Crossref DOIs to DataCite DOIs. Crossref is the central linking hub for scholarly communications. Publishers deposit metadata about articles as they are published. This includes links to datasets via DataCite.</li>
<li>Links from DataCite DOIs to Crossref DOIs. Researchers deposit scholarly research objects for citation to DataCite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Researchers deposit datasets and provide links to scholarly works via Crossref DOIs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter DOI mentions. People discuss scholarly works via their DOIs, or the landing pages to which those DOIs resolve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crossref works with the Twitter data source, filtering Crossref and DataCite DOIs and corresponding landing pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia DOI citations and uncitations. Wikipedia pages are edited on a constant basis. A page can reference a DOI, and an edit to a page can introduce or remove a link to a DOI.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crossref tracks when these events happen and records when a DOI is added or removed from a page, the DOI, and the page and revision numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data supplied by other providers. Providers are able to push events, such as a DOI is annotation or download, into the Crossref Event Data service. The content of the event is dependent on the type of source. Crossref Event Data will make the event available verbatim. Events are supplied by the party that generated them.</li>
<li>Facebook. Facebook Graph API allows Crossref Event Data to query for every DOI it knows about and record how many times a DOI was shared, liked, and commented on. Each time this data are collected is treated as an event.</li>

<ul>
<li>Links from DataCite DOIs to Crossref DOIs. DataCite identifies deposits and updates Crossref Event Data when it sees a Crossref DOI cited. This will happen in bulk for historical data, and then will be done live as new deposits are made.</li>
<li>Twitter DOI mentions. Crossref Crossref Event Data subscribes to the Twitter firehose, filtering it by Crossref and DataCite DOIs and those domains that DOIs resolve to. It stores all tweets that mention DOIs. For tweets that mention article or dataset landing pages, Crossref Event Data will attempt to identify the corresponding DOI and record that link (including both the DOI and the landing page URL). Not all landing pages URLs can be mapped to DOIs, but if a new technique enables a previously unknown mapping for a historical tweet, this event will be raised. The firehose is a live stream.</li>
<li>Wikipedia DOI citations and uncitations. Crossref Crossref Event Data subscribes to the Wikipedia live stream of edits. For every edit that is made to any Wikipedia article, Crossref Event Data will analyze the content of the edit and look for DOIs having been added or removed. An event will be recorded for either the adding or removal of a DOI in a Wikipedia page. The edit stream is live and produces a live stream of events.</li>
<li>Data provided by other providers. Crossref Crossref Event Data provides a âPush APIâ that enables data sources to push data into Crossref Event Data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providers can push data in batches or live. This is a generic capability, but allows for significant players in the scholarly space to publish DOI event data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook: The Facebook API is queried for every DOI that belongs to Crossref or DataCite. The results are stored directly. The Facebook API is queried periodically. There are no guarantees about how often the Facebook API is queried as this depends on practical issues of scalability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="describe-all-known-limitations-of-the-data.">4: Describe all known limitations of the data.</h4>
<p>A3</p>
<p>Pull sources are limited to the selection of DOIs, see the <a href="#sources">Sources</a> section for details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Links from Crossref DOIs to DataCite DOIs. Publishers must provide data. Crossref has around 5,000 publisher members and there are some variabilities among them.</li>
<li>Links from DataCite DOIs to Crossref DOIs. Researchers must provide data to DataCite.</li>
<li>Twitter DOI mentions. All DOIs in tweets can be reliably identified. In the case of landing pages, Crossref Crossref Event Data will make a best effort to resolve the landing pages, but there is no 100 percent reliable way to do this.</li>
<li>Wikipedia DOI citations and uncitations. The Wikipedia live stream or supporting infrastructure may become unavailable. If this happens, those events will be missed.</li>
<li>Data provided by other providers. The content of pushed data are the responsibility of those pushing the data. However, as they are the source, the data they do push can be considered to be canonical and of the best available quality.</li>
<li>Facebook. As Crossref Crossref Event Data will be querying the Facebook API for a large number of DOIs, the period between updates is entirely dependent on practical scaling issues. Crossref Event Data may prioritize fetching data for DOIs that are more likely to have activity.</li>

</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Does CED collect data for all DOIs in existence?</dt>
<dd>CED is able to accept data for any DOI but does not store every DOI in its internal list because we do not expect there to be Event Data for every DOI. For this reason, Pull Sources do not collect full data for every DOI. See <a href="#selection-of-dois">Selection of DOIs</a>.
</dd>
<dt>Which Registration Agencies' DOIs does CED use?</dt>
<dd>CED is is a joint venture by Crossref and DataCite. It is able to collect DOIs from any DOI Registration Agency (RA), and most sources don't check which RA a DOI belongs to. So in theory, some MEDRA DOIs might end up being deposited. However, some sources (such as <a href="#twitter">Twitter</a>) target only Crossref and DataCite DOIs. Check the individual sources for full details (see <a href="#sources">Sources</a>).

<dt>How long are Deposits available?</dt>

<dt>You have a Deposit API and a Relation API. What is the difference?</dt>
<dd>Before the MVP Technical blog post, we wonât have released info about these two items. When will the interviews occur? Also not sure about the latter term, Reflection API.
</dd>
<dt>Will the data be auditable?</dt>
<dd>Yes. Based on our auditability guidelines, we will provide authorised access to a separate storage location for the purposes of obtaining data evidence for audits.
</dd>
<dt>Where will you store the data?</dt>
<dd>The Event Data collection of deposit data will be held in both short and long-term storage and will be accessible to the public via our deposit API or the Crossref Metadata Search page.
</dd>
<dt>Can I use the data to feed into my commercial tool?</dt>
<dd>Yes. We do not clean or aggregate the data we collect so that any commercial vendor has the opportunity to do this themselves in order to use the data in the way which best suits their commercial needs.
</dd>
<dt>Can you guarantee coverage of events across the sources?</dt>
<dd>Comment from Jennifer: âguaranteesâ are very tricky. weâre going to need to get our lawyer, Lois, to provide wording surrounding this later on before launch. Letâs leave this for now.

<dt>Is your code base open source?</dt>
<dd>Yes, we use the open source Lagotto code base.

<dt>When will Event Data be launched?</dt>
<dd>The MVP will be launch at the end of March, along with a Sandbox testing environment for interested users to test the pull and push sources available at that point (facebook and Wikipedia). We will release the full clearinghouse around July/August 2016 and then the SLA service in November 2016.
